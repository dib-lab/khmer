================================================
1. Quality Trimming and Filtering Your Sequences
================================================

Boot up an m1.xlarge machine from Amazon Web Services; this has about
15 GB of RAM, and 2 CPUs, and will be enough to complete the assembly
of the Nematostella data set.

.. note::

   This follows the NGS 2013 tutorial,
   `Short-read quality evaluation <http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2013/short-read-quality-evaluation.html>`__,
   but for multiple files.

.. note::

   The end results of this tutorial are available as public snapshot
   snap-8b155fd9 on EC2/EBS.

Install software
----------------

Install screed::

   cd /usr/local/share
   git clone https://github.com/ged-lab/screed.git
   cd screed
   python setup.py install

Install the bleeding-edge version of khmer::

   cd /usr/local/share
   git clone https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer.git -b bleeding-edge
   cd khmer
   make

   echo 'export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/share/khmer/python' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc

Install Trimmomatic::

   cd /root
   curl -O http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.27.zip
   unzip Trimmomatic-0.27.zip 
   cp Trimmomatic-0.27/trimmomatic-0.27.jar /usr/local/bin

Install libgtextutils and fastx::

   cd /root
   curl -O http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/libgtextutils-0.6.1.tar.bz2
   tar xjf libgtextutils-0.6.1.tar.bz2 
   cd libgtextutils-0.6.1/
   ./configure && make && make install

   cd /root
   curl -O http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/fastx_toolkit-0.0.13.2.tar.bz2
   tar xjf fastx_toolkit-0.0.13.2.tar.bz2
   cd fastx_toolkit-0.0.13.2/
   ./configure && make && make install

In each of these cases, we're downloading the software -- you can use
google to figure out what each package is and does if we don't discuss
it below.  We're then unpacking it, sometimes compiling it (which we
can discuss later), and then installing it for general use.

Find your data
--------------

Either load in your own data (as in :doc:`0-download-and-save`) or
create a volume from snapshot snap-f5a9dea7 and mount it as ``/data``
(again, this is the data from `Tulin et al., 2013
<http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/4/1/16>`__).

Check::

   ls /data

If you see all the files you think you should, good!  Otherwise, debug.

If you're using the Tulin et al. data provided in the snapshot above,
you should see a bunch of files like::

   /data/0Hour_ATCACG_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz

Link your data into a working directory
---------------------------------------

Rather than *copying* the files into the working directory, let's just
*link* them in -- this creates a reference so that UNIX knows where to
find them but doesn't need to actually move them around. ::

   cd /mnt
   mkdir work
   cd work

   ln -fs /data/*.fastq.gz .

(The 'ln' command is what does the linking.)

Now, do an 'ls' to list the files.  If you see only one entry, ``*.fastq.gz``,
then the ln command above didn't work properly.  One possibility is that
your files aren't in /data; another is that they're not named *.fastq.gz.

Download the Illumina adapters
------------------------------

In the working directory, ::

   curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.ged.msu.edu/illuminaClipping.fa

.. note::

   You'll need to make sure these are the right adapters for your data.
   If they are, you should see that some of them are trimmed off, below;
   if they're not, you shouldn't see anything get trimmed.

Adapter trim each pair of files
-------------------------------

(From this point on, you may want to be running things inside of
screen, so that you detach and log out while it's running; see
:doc:`using-screen` for more information.)

If you're following along using the Nematostella data, you should have a
bunch of files that look like this (use 'ls' to show them)::

   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz
                       ^^

Each file with an R1 in its name should have a matching file with an R2 --
these are the paired ends.

.. note::

   You'll need to replace <R1 FILE> and <R2 FILE>, below, with the
   names of your actual R1 and R2 files.  You'll also need to replace
   <SAMPLE NAME> with something that's unique to each pair of files.
   It doesn't really matter what, but you need to make sure it's different
   for each pair of files.

For *each* of these pairs, run the following::

   # make a temp directory
   mkdir trim
   cd trim

   # run trimmomatic
   java -jar /usr/local/bin/trimmomatic-0.27.jar PE <R1 FILE> <R2 FILE> s1_pe s1_se s2_pe s2_se ILLUMINACLIP:../illuminaClipping.fa:2:30:10

   # interleave the remaining paired-end files
   /usr/local/share/khmer/scripts/interleave-reads.py s1_pe s2_pe | gzip -9c > ../<SAMPLE NAME>.pe.fq.gz

   # combine the single-ended files
   cat s1_se s2_se | gzip -9c > ../<SAMPLE NAME>.se.fq.gz

   # go back up to the working directory and remove the temp directory
   cd ..
   rm -r trim

   # make it hard to delete the files you just created
   chmod u-w *.pe.fq.gz *.se.fq.gz

To get a basic idea of what's going on, please read the '#' comments
above, but, briefly, this set of commands:

* creates a temporary directory, 'trim/'

* runs 'Trimmomatic' in that directory to trim off the adapters, and then
  puts remaining pairs (most of them!) in s1_pe and s2_pe, and any orphaned
  singletons in s1_se and s2_se.

* interleaves the paired ends and puts them back in the working directory

* combines the orphaned reads and puts them back in the working directory

At the end of this you will have new files ending in '.pe.fq.gz' and
'.se.fq.gz', representing the paired and orphaned quality trimmed
reads, respectively.

Automating things a bit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OK, once you've done this once or twice, it gets kind of tedious, doesn't it?
I've written a script to write these commands out automatically.  Run it
like so::

   cd /mnt/work
   python /usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox/write-trimmomatic.py > trim.sh

Run this, and then look at 'trim.sh' using the 'more' command -- ::

   more trim.sh

If it looks like it contains the right commands, you can run it by doing::

   bash trim.sh

.. note::

   This is a prime example of scripting to make your life much easier
   and less error prone.  Take a look at this file sometime --
   'more /usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox/write-trimmomatic.py' -- to get
   some idea of how this works.

Quality trim each pair of files
-------------------------------

After you run this, you should have a bunch of '.pe.fq.gz' files and
a bunch of '.se.fq.gz' files.  The former are files that contain paired,
interleaved sequences; the latter contain single-ended, non-interleaved
sequences.

Next, for each of these files, run::

   gunzip -c <filename> | fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 | gzip -9c > <filename>.qc.fq.gz

This uncompresses each file, removes poor-quality sequences, and then
recompresses it.  Note that (following `Short-read quality evaluation
<http://kbroman.wordpress.com/2013/08/20/electronic-lab-notebook/>`__)
you can also trim to a specific length by putting in a 'fastx_trimmer
-Q33 -l 70 |' into the mix.

If fastq_quality_filter complains about invalid quality scores, try
removing the -Q33 in the command; Illumina has blessed us with multiple
quality score encodings.

Automating this step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step can be automated with a 'for' loop at the shell prompt.  Try::

   for i in *.pe.fq.gz *.se.fq.gz
   do
        echo working with $i
	newfile="$(basename $i .fq.gz)"
	gunzip -c $i | fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 | gzip -9c > "${newfile}.qc.fq.gz"
   done

What this loop does is:

* for every file ending in pe.fq.gz and se.fq.gz,

* print out a message with the filename,

* construct a name 'newfile' that omits the trailing .fq.gz

* uncompresses the original file, passes it through fastq, recompresses it,
  and saves it as 'newfile'.qc.fq.gz

Extracting paired ends from the interleaved files
-------------------------------------------------

The fastx utilities that we're using to do quality trimming aren't
paired-end aware; they're removing individual sequences.  Because the
pe files are interleaved, this means that there may now be some orphaned
sequences in there.  Downstream, we will want to pay special attention
to the remaining paired sequences, so we want to separate out the pe
and se files.  How do we go about that?  Another script, of course!

The khmer script 'strip-and-split-for-assembly.py' does exactly that.
You run it on an interleaved file that may have some orphans, and it
produces .pe and .se files afterwards, containing pairs and orphans
respectively.

To run it on all of the pe qc files, do::

   for i in *.pe.qc.fq.gz
   do
      /usr/local/share/khmer/scripts/extract-paired-reads.py $i
   done

Finishing up
------------

You should now have a whole mess of files. For example, in the Nematostella
data, for *each* of the original input files, you'll have::

   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz 	      	     - the original data
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.pe.fq.gz		     - adapter trimmed pe
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.pe.qc.fq.gz	     - FASTX filtered
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.pe.qc.fq.gz.pe	     - FASTX filtered PE
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.pe.qc.fq.gz.se	     - FASTX filtered SE
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.se.fq.gz		     - adapter trimmed orphans
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.se.qc.fq.gz	     - FASTX filtered orphans

Yikes!  What to do?

Well, first, you can get rid of the original data.  You already have it on a
disk somewhere, right? ::

   rm *.fastq.gz

Next, you can get rid of the 'pe.fq.gz' and 'se.fq.gz' files, since you
only want the QC files.  So::

   rm *.pe.fq.gz *.se.fq.gz

And, finally, you can toss the pe.fq.gz files, because you've turned *those*
into .pe and .se files. ::

   rm *.pe.qc.fq.gz

So now you should be left with only three files for each sample::

   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.pe.qc.fq.gz.pe   - FASTX filtered PE
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.pe.qc.fq.gz.se   - FASTX filtered SE
   24HourB_GCCAAT_L002_R1_001.se.qc.fq.gz      - FASTX filtered orphans

Things to think about
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the filenames, while ugly, are conveniently structured with the
history of what you've done.  This is a good idea.

Also note that we've conveniently named the files so that we can remove
the unwanted ones en masse.  This is a good idea, too.

Renaming files
--------------

I'm a fan of keeping the files named somewhat sensibly, and keeping them
compressed.  Let's do some mass renaming::

   for i in *.pe.qc.fq.gz.pe
   do
      newfile="$(basename $i .pe.qc.fq.gz.pe).pe.qc.fq"
      mv $i $newfile
      gzip $newfile
   done

and also some mass combining::

   for i in *.pe.qc.fq.gz.se
   do
     otherfile="$(basename $i .pe.qc.fq.gz.se).se.qc.fq.gz"
     gunzip -c $otherfile > combine
     cat $i >> combine
     gzip -c combine > $otherfile
     rm $i
   done

and finally, make the end product files read-only::

   chmod u-w *.qc.fq.gz

to make sure you don't accidentally delete something.

Saving the files
----------------

At this point, you should save these files, which will be used in two
ways: first, for assembly; and second, for mapping, to do quantitation
and ultimately comparative expression analysis.  You can save them by
doing this::

   mkdir save
   mv *.qc.fq.gz save
   du -sk save

This puts the data you want to save into a subdirectory named 'save', and
calculates the size.

Now, create a volume of the given size -- divide by a thousand to get
gigabytes, multiply by 1.1 to make sure you have enough room, and then
follow the instructions in :doc:`saving-data-persistently`.  Once
you've mounted it properly (I would suggest mounting it on /save
instead of /data!), then do ::

   rsync -av save /save

which will copy all of the files over from the ./save directory onto the
'/save' disk.  Then 'umount /save' and voila, you've got a copy of the files!

Next stop: :doc:`2-diginorm`.
