5. Building transcript families and annotating the sequences
============================================================

Install khmer, screed, and BLAST.  (See :doc:`1-quality` and
:doc:`installing-blastkit`).  I would suggest using an m1.large or
m1.xlarge machine.

You'll also need to install some eel-pond scripts::

   cd /usr/local/share
   git clone https://github.com/ctb/eel-pond.git
   cd eel-pond
   git checkout protocols-v0.8.3

Copy in your data
=================

You need to get ahold of your assembled transcriptome (from
e.g. :doc:`3-big-assembly`).  Put it in /mnt.

For the purposes of your first run through, I suggest just grabbing my copy
of the Nematostella assembly::

   cd /mnt
   curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.ged.msu.edu/trinity-nematostella-raw.fa.gz

Run khmer partitioning
======================

Partitioning runs a de Bruijn graph-based clustering algorithm that will
cluster your transcripts by transitive sequence overlap.  That is, it will
build transcript families :). ::

   /usr/local/share/khmer/scripts/do-partition.py -x 1e9 -N 4 --threads 4 nema trinity-nematostella-raw.fa.gz

This should take about 15 minutes, and outputs a file ending in '.part'
that contains the partition assignments.  Now, group and rename the
sequences::

   python /usr/local/share/eel-pond/rename-with-partitions.py nema trinity-nematostella-raw.fa.gz.part
   mv trinity-nematostella-raw.fa.gz.part.renamed.fasta.gz trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa.gz

.. tail n.dist
.. (warning)

.. 

.. (explain sequence names)

Looking at the renamed sequences
================================

Let's look at the renamed sequences::

   gunzip -c trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa.gz | head

You'll see that each sequence name looks like this::

   >nema.id1.tr16001 1_of_1_in_tr16001 len=261 id=1 tr=16001

Some explanation:

* 'nema' is the prefix that you gave the rename script, above; modify
  accordingly for your own organism.  It's best to change it each time
  you do an assembly, just to keep things straight.

* 'idN' is the unique ID for this sequence; it will never be repeated in this
   file.

* 'trN' is the transcript family, which may contain one or more transcripts.

* '1_of_1_in_tr16001' tells you that this transcript family has only
  one transcript in it (this one!) Other transcript families may
  (will) have more.

* 'len' is the sequence length.

Doing a preliminary annotation against mouse
============================================

Now let's assign putative homology & orthology to these transcripts, by
doing BLASTs & reciprocal best hit analysis.  First, uncompress your
transcripts file::

   gunzip trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa.gz 

Now, grab the latest mouse RefSeq::

   curl -O ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/M_musculus/mRNA_Prot/mouse.protein.faa.gz
   gunzip mouse.protein.faa.gz

Format both as BLAST databases::

   formatdb -i mouse.protein.faa -o T -p T
   formatdb -i trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa -o T -p F

And, now, run BLAST in both directions.  Note, this may take ~24 hours or
longer; you probably want to run it in screen::

   blastall -i trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa -d mouse.protein.faa -e 1e-3 -p blastx -o nema.x.mouse -a 8 -v 4 -b 4
   blastall -i mouse.protein.faa -d trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa -e 1e-3 -p tblastn -o mouse.x.nema -a 8 -v 4 -b 4

.. note::

   These BLASTs will take a *long* time, like 24-36 hours.  If you want to
   work with canned BLASTs, do::

      curl -O http://athyra.idyll.org/~t/nema.x.mouse.gz
      curl -O http://athyra.idyll.org/~t/mouse.x.nema.gz
      gunzip nema.x.mouse.gz
      gunzip mouse.x.nema.gz

Assigning names to sequences
============================

Now, calculate putative homology (best BLAST hit) and orthology
(reciprocal best hits)::

   python /usr/local/share/eel-pond/make-uni-best-hits.py nema.x.mouse nema.x.mouse.homol
   python /usr/local/share/eel-pond/make-reciprocal-best-hits.py nema.x.mouse mouse.x.nema nema.x.mouse.ortho

Prepare some of the mouse info::

   python /usr/local/share/eel-pond/make-namedb.py mouse.protein.faa mouse.namedb
   python -m screed.fadbm mouse.protein.faa

And, finally, annotate the sequences::

   python /usr/local/share/eel-pond/annotate-seqs.py trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa nema.x.mouse.ortho nema.x.mouse.homol

This will produce a file 'trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa.annot', which
will have sequences that look like this::

   >nematostella.id1.tr115222 h=43% => suppressor of tumorigenicity 7 protein isoform 2 [Mus musculus] 1_of_7_in_tr115222 len=1635 id=1 tr=115222 1_of_7_in_tr115222 len=1635 id=1 tr=115222

I suggest renaming this file to 'nematostella.fa' and using it for
BLASTs (see :doc:`installing-blastkit`).
