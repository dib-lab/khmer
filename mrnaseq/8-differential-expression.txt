8. Differential expression (with EBSeq)
=======================================

.. note::

   You can also start with the data on snap-1025bf17; mount it as /data
   and do::

      cd /mnt
      cp /data/nematostella.fa.gz ./trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa.gz
      mkdir ebseq
      cd ebseq

      rsem-generate-data-matrix /data/[0-9].fq.genes.results /data/10.fq.genes.results > 0-vs-6-hour.matrix

.. note::

   If all you have is a genes.results file, you can recover the
   *.fq.genes.results files by doing the following::
 
         python /usr/local/share/eel-pond/unpack-genes-matrix.py genes.results

   Now run ``rsem-generate-data-matrix`` to put together the columns you're
   interested in for the pairwise comparison.

Go to /mnt and make a new directory::

   cd /mnt
   mkdir ebseq
   cd ebseq
   cp ../rsem/0-vs-6-hour.matrix .

Next, run EBSeq::

   rsem-run-ebseq 0-vs-6-hour.matrix 5,5 0-vs-6-hour.changed

Here, the .matrix file contains 2 conditions, each with 5 replicates;
if you had two replicates, you would call rsem-run-ebseq with 2,2.

The EBSeq output will be in '0-vs-6-hour.changed'.  `Read the docs
<http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/rsem-run-ebseq.html>`__ to
understand what's in the output file -- you're most interested in the
PPDE (posterior probability that a transcript is differentially
expressed) and the PostFC (posterior fold change) columns, columns 4
and 5.

Finally, let's extract differentially expressed genes, and combine
them with the annotations in your transcripts file. ::

   python /usr/local/share/eel-pond/extract-and-annotate-changed.py 0-vs-6-hour.changed /mnt/trinity-nematostella.renamed.fa.gz 0-vs-6-hour.changed.csv

This will produce a file containing many rows, each with 5 columns:
each row is a transcript family, and the columns are the probability
of that transcript family being differentially expressed (according to
EBSeq), the posterior fold change (calculated by EBSeq), the real
fold change (EBSeq), the transcript family name, and any annotations
that have been assigned to that transcript family.

This file can be opened directly in Excel or most any spreadsheet program.

To visualize the distribution of gene expression in the two conditions you
can do::

   python /usr/local/share/eel-pond/plot-expression.py 0-vs-6-hour.matrix 5,5 0-vs-6-hour.changed.csv

This will produce a .PNG image showing all of the genes' expression levels
in condition 1 against their levels in condition 2, and will show in a
separate color those genes that are differentially expressed.  Running it
on the demo data set will produce an image as below

...and that's all, folks!
