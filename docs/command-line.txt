=======================
Commandline conventions
=======================

Throughout this documentation code is surrounded by green boxes. We use certain
conventions in presenting command lines and their arguments.

The most common example of this is the use of "<variablename>", when you see
this in code you should replace both the words and the brackets  with the
appropriate contents as suggested by the name we used.
