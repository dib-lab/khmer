Architecture and Design
=======================

What follows is an attempt to describe the overall architecture and design of
the *khmer* software under the hood. Where appropriate, implementation details
will be mentioned. Also, possible future directions and design considerations
will be mentioned as appropriate.

Overview
--------

Data pumps stage data from disk storage into an in-memory cache. The in-memory
cache is divided into segments, one segment per thread. A cache manager exposes
an interface for staging the data via the data pumps and for accessing the data
in the cache segments. Read parsers convert the staged data into read
objects. A separate state object is maintained for each thread using a parser.
Existing-tracking or counting Bloom filters can use the read parsers as a
source of reads from which to extract k-mers.

The read parsers and the layers under them can be controlled via global
configuration objects, which provide default values during their instantiation.
In many cases, these default values can also be overriden by supplying
pertinent arguments to the constructors. Only one global configuration object
is considered active at a given time; but, a singleton pattern is not enforced
and more than one may be available to supply alternative configurations.

The top-level makefile for the project contains a user-configurable section,
wherein preprocessor, compiler, and linker options may be selected via
convenient, prefabricated bundles. The ability to generate profiling
instrumentation, compile with debugging symbols, and to generate tracing
instrumentation are all controlled via these option bundles. The lower levels
of the code, such as the data pumps, cache manager, and read parsers all have
significant built-in profiling and tracing instrumentation. This
instrumentation is conditionally-compiled according to the option bundles
selected in the top-level makefile.

Namespace
---------

Unless otherwise noted, all C++ classes, functions, and static variables noted
in this document are members of the ``khmer`` namespace. Likewise, unless
otherwise noted, all Python classes, functions, and module variables noted in
this document are members of the ``khmer`` module.

.. cpp:namespace:: khmer

.. py:module:: khmer

.. todo::
   Use ``breathe`` to interface with ``Doxygen`` for better documentation.

Configuration Objects
---------------------

C++ API
~~~~~~~

The declaration of the configuration objects is contained in
:file:`lib/khmer_config.hh`.

.. cpp:class:: Config

.. cpp:function:: Config &get_active_config( )

.. cpp:function:: void set_active_config( Config &c )
   
An *active* configuration object is always present. A reference to this object
is supplied via the :cpp:func:`get_active_config` function. The initial
settings of the active configuration object are quite conservative. New
configuration objects are created with the empty constructor; all settings
modifications occur upon already-created instances via their setter methods.
The active configuration object can be set via the
:cpp:func:`set_active_config` function, which takes a reference to a
:cpp:class:`Config` object as its only argument.

Except for read-only configuration options, such as extra sanity checking,
which are determined at the time of compilation, the configuration options are
manipulated via getter/setter methods. The most prominent or useful 
getter/setter methods are the following: 

.. cpp:function:: uint32_t Config::get_number_of_threads( ) const

.. cpp:function:: void Config::set_number_of_threads( uint32_t const n )

.. cpp:function:: uint64_t const Config::get_reads_input_buffer_size( ) const

.. cpp:function:: void Config::set_reads_input_buffer_size( uint64_t const sz )

Python API
~~~~~~~~~~

The :cpp:class:`Config` objects are exposed in the Python wrapper.

.. py:function:: get_config( )

.. py:function:: set_config( c )

The C++ getter/setter methods are exposed via the same names in Python.

.. todo::
   The getter/setter methods should be exposed as properties in Python.

Trace Loggers
-------------

Trace loggers can log execution traces and other useful debugging information
to files on a per-thread basis. This makes them very useful for debugging
multi-threaded code, especially in the absence of advanced commerical
debuggers, such as DDT or TotalView. Trace loggers are contolled via several
user-configurable variables in the top-level makefile. As of this writing,
these variables are ``WITH_INTERNAL_TRACING``, ``TRACE_STATE_CHANGES``,
``TRACE_BUSYWAITS``, ``TRACE_SPINLOCKS``, ``TRACE_MEMCOPIES``, and
``TRACE_DATA``. The ``TRACE_`` options are ineffective unless
``WITH_INTERNAL_TRACING`` is set to ``true``.

.. todo::
   Replace the editing of makefiles with a configure script or else move to an
   all-Pythonic regime where the user would edit :file:`setup.cfg`. See 
   `issue #9 <https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/issues/9>`_ in the Github issue
   tracker for the project.

The data pump and read parser code, as well as some of the Bloom filter code,
is impregnated with trace loggers. Other parts of the source code could use
them as well.

Trace logger objects are not exposed directly via the Python wrapper; they are
only available in the C++ API. The trace logger class is declared in the
:file:`lib/trace_logger.hh` file.

.. cpp:class:: TraceLogger

Tracing be performed at coarser or finer levels of detail, as desired. An
enumeration of named integral constants provides the available levels. The use
of ``TLVL_ALL`` will trace everything which is instrumented for tracing. After
that, ``TLVL_DEBUG9`` is the next finest level of detail. The enumeration
ascends to higher and higher numerical values which indicate more coarseness;
specifically the ordering is trace levels ``TLVL_DEBUG8`` through
``TLVL_DEBUG0``, followed by ``TLVL_INFO9`` through ``TLVL_INFO0``, and then
``TLVL_WARNING``, ``TLVL_ERROR``, and ``TLVL_CRITICAL``. The special level
``TLVL_NONE`` means that nothing will be traced even though tracing may be
activated at compile time. Note that ``TLVL_ALL`` corresponds to 0 and
``TLVL_NONE`` corresponds to 255; this is useful for setting trace levels in
method arguments via the Python interface.

.. todo::
   Expose trace level names via the Python interface.

.. todo::
   Allow C++ :cpp:class:`TraceLogger` objects to be targets of Python
   :py:mod:`logging` module?

Two constructors are available for instantiating objects of type
:cpp:class:`TraceLogger`. One takes the trace level and a ``FILE *`` stream
handle. The other takes the trace level, a file name format string, and a
variable number of arguments to ``sprintf`` into that format string. This form
exists so that trace files, named according to logical thread ID, can be
created, for example. The trace level argument is the finest requested level of
detail which will be traced by the object.

The objects instantiated by these constructors are *function objects* (also
sometimes known as *functors* to the chagrin of some mathematicians). This is
to say that the objects may be called.

.. cpp:function:: void TraceLogger::operator( )( uint8_t const level, char const * const format, ...) const

The ``level`` argument is the desired level of detail. If the object was
instantiated for a coarser level than the requested level, then nothing will be
logged. The ``format`` argument is the format string for the underlying
``fprintf`` call and a variable number of arguments may be supplied for use
with this format string.

Performance Metrics
-------------------

Performance metrics can be gathered on a per-thread basis and can measure
things which are not covered by traditional profiling tools. Such metrics may
include the input or output rate in bytes per second, for example. Not all
platforms support the high resolution, per-thread timers needed to effectively
use these metrics.

The Python wrapper does not presently support reporting on performance metrics.

.. todo::
   Support reporting on performance metrics from within the Python wrapper.

The performance metrics abstract base class is declared in the
:file:`lib/perf_metrics.hh` file. This class is subclassed for various specific
domains.

.. cpp:class:: IPerformanceMetrics

The class provides a hassle-free stopwatch.

.. cpp:function:: void IPerformanceMetrics::start_timers( )

.. cpp:function:: void IPerformanceMetrics::stop_timers( )

These functions record the amount of physical time elapsed since the thread was
created and the amount of time that the thread has spent using CPU cores. Two
sets of internal scratch variables are used for this purpose: one set of start
times and one set of stop times.

.. warning::
   Because of the use of internal scratch variables, these methods are not
   reentrant. Timer deltas must be collected before new calls can be issued to
   the stopwatch. This is the trade-off for convenience....

Once start and stop times have been accumulated, then a timer delta can be
calculated and stowed in the appropriate category. Categories are determined by
keys which are defined in subclasses of the abstract class. The delta
accumulator takes a category key as an argument and is declared pure virtual in
the abstract base class so that it must be implemented in subclasses where they
category keys are enumerated.

.. cpp:function:: void IPerformanceMetrics::accumulate_timer_deltas( uint32_t metrics_key )

Input Data Pumps
----------------

An input data pump object copies data from a file into a cache in memory. Since
accesses to memory are typically three orders of magnitude faster than to an
individual hard disk drive and since many operations to process the data are
slower than reading it from a file, it makes sense to stage some of it into
memory. Having the data in memory can reduce the latency from accessing it upon
demand. And, the cache in memory can be filled more rapidly than it is
processed.

The input data pumps are declared in :file:`lib/read_parsers.hh`. All of them
derive from an abstract base class.

.. todo::
   Refactor the data pumps into a separate header and implementation file.

.. cpp:class:: IStreamReader

Presently, three types of data pumps are implemented.

.. cpp:class:: RawStreamReader

.. cpp:class:: GzStreamReader

.. cpp:class:: Bz2StreamReader

These input data pumps are not exposed via the Python wrapper.

The :cpp:class:`IStreamReader` interface defines one method of interest.

.. cpp:function:: uint64_t const read_into_cache( uint8_t * const cache, uint64_t const cache_size )

This is a pure virtual method which must be overridden in subclasses. The
``cache`` parameter receives an argument which is an arbitrary piece of memory
which it treats as an array of bytes. The ``cache_size`` parameter receives an
argument which is the size, in bytes, of the cache. The return value is the
number of bytes read into the cache from file.

Raw Stream Reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The raw stream reader is constructed from a file descriptor, such as returned
by the ``open`` system call. An optional read alignment may be supplied to this
constructor. Depending on the operating system and file system, this may be
used as a chunk size and alignment for *direct I/O*. Otherwise, it is ignored.
Direct I/O allows for blocks to copied directly from a block device into
user-space memory rather than passing through a kernel-space block cache first.
This reduces the number of memory copies involved in processing the data.

.. warning::
   Direct I/O has received some testing within the software, but has not been
   tested enough to be considered production-ready.

.. note::
   In principle, the file descriptor could number 0 (stdin) and one could
   create pipelines, but this is not supported at the higher level interfaces.

Reading is currently performed in a synchronous manner, which is fine for most
typical use cases of the software since input is not the bottleneck.

.. todo::
   Support asynchronous reading.


Gzip Stream Reader and Decompressor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The stream reader and decompressor for the ``gzip`` format is based on
``zlib``. No direct I/O is supported by this stream reader and its constructor
therefore only accepts a file descriptor. Furthermore, data must be copied and
decompressed sequentially and cannot be read asynchronously. In the regime that
higher level processing is fast, this stream reader is likely to be a
bottleneck, especially as there is overhead from decompression. However, as
pipelining support does not yet exist in the software, providing native support
for a popular compression format makes sense. Also, some users of the software
may not be familiar with standard Unix compression tools, such as ``gzip``;
built-in support of popular compression formats removes a barrier to entry for
these users.

.. todo::
   Implement higher level support for pipelining so that parallelized
   decompressors can feed a raw stream reader, assuming that they can output
   decompressed data to stdout and do so in order. Alternatively, if a
   parallelized variant of ``zlib`` can be found, then that should be used in
   place of ``zlib`` for native support.

Bzip2 Stream Reader and Decompressor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The stream reader and decompressor for the ``bzip2`` format is based on the
``bzip2`` library. The same notes and considerations for the ``gzip`` stream
reader also apply to this one as well.

As a historical note, it is worth mentioning that the logic for reading from a
``bzip2``-compressed file stream is significantly more complicated than for raw
or ``gzip``-compressed streams because of the way the library API is structured
and the nature of the compression format. Prior to the architecture being
described, data pumps and reads parsers were tightly coupled and implementing a
``bzip2`` data pump in that architecture would have been very painful. As it
turns out, the current architecture preemptively fixed a bug in the old
``gzip`` data pump before it was reported against that architecture. So, this
decoupled design has already paid for itself several times over.

Thread Identity Maps
--------------------

Higher level processing requires that threads be able to persistently work with
the same set of data. A thread does not inherently "know" what its index into a
particular lookup table is. However, this index can be mapped to an OS-native 
identifier for a thread. Using an appropriate system call, a thread can query
its own native identifier from the operating system and then use this as a map
key to find its logical identifier within the software. This logical identifier
serves as the thread's index into any lookup tables which it may need to use.

The self-identification is also important on the grounds of a software
engineering principle: don't break existing interfaces. Prior to the current
architecture, the code was not thread-safe. In order to add thread-safety in a
reliable manner and not break existing interfaces, self-identification of
threads was necessary.

The thread identity map class is declared in the :file:`lib/thread_id_map.hh`
file.

.. cpp:class:: ThreadIDMap

This class is not exposed via the Python wrapper as it is an internal
mechanism. And, the implementation of the class varies according to operating 
system. The only important method for those who wish to avail themselves to
this bookkeeping method is the one which returns the logical identifier (lookup
table index) of the current thread.

.. cpp:function:: uint32_t const ThreadIDMap::get_thread_id( )

New entries are added to the map as new threads call this method for the first
time. Thus, the bookkeeping is automatic and does not get in the way of the
developer.

Cache Managers
--------------

A cache manager provides memory into which an input data pump may copy. The
provided memory is segmented on a per-thread basis. On machines with multiple
NUMA nodes, this can help performance by decreasing the likelihood of
cross-node fetches and stores. More importantly, it provides an association
between a particular thread and a particular cache segment, so that higher
level processing, such as parsing, can always be guaranteed to operate on the
same contiguous portion of memory.

.. todo::
   Implement pinning of threads to specific cores on operating systems which
   support this. Preventing the migration of threads between cores should
   mostly eliminate cross-node fetches and stores.

The :file:`lib/read_parsers.hh` file declares the cache manager and cache
manager segment classes.

.. cpp:class:: CacheManager

.. cpp:class:: CacheManagerSegment

As multiple threads share access to the same data pump, the cache manager
orchestrates access to this resource. Internally, a spinlock is used to limit
access to one thread at a time.

.. todo::
   Increase period of spinlock trials from once per iteration to something
   greater, similar to what the other busywaiters which perform atomic tests
   use.

Internally, a :cpp:class:`ThreadIDMap` is used to match a current thread with
its corresponding entry in the table of cache segments. A convenience method is
provided for the current thread to find its corresponding cache segment,
creating it if it doesn't already exist.

.. cpp:function:: CacheSegment &CacheManger::_get_segment( bool const higher = false )

This is a private method used only within cache mangers. The ``higher``
parameter is vestigial remnant from an earlier implementation and can likely be
removed.

.. todo::
   Remove the ``higher`` parameter from :cpp:func:`_get_segment`.

Developers wishing to use a cache manager rather than muck around in its
implementation will probably find the following methods most useful.

.. cpp:function:: bool const CacheManager::has_more_data( )

.. cpp:function:: uint64_t const CacheManager::get_bytes( uint8_t * const buffer, uint64_t buffer_len )

.. cpp:function:: void CacheManager::split_at( uint64_t const pos )

The :cpp:func:`has_more_data` method queries both the underlying stream and the
current cache segment to see if more data is available. If both the underlying
stream is exhausted and the memory cursor, which tracks how much of a cache
segment has been accessed since its last refill, is at the end of the segment,
then no more data is considered to be available and the current thread hits a
synchronization barrier to wait for the other threads to finish.

The :cpp:func:`get_bytes` method copies up to ``buffer_len`` bytes of memory
from the current cache segment into the supplied buffer ``buffer``. All
bookkeeping, such as replenishing the cache segment from the underlying stream,
is handled behind the scenes. The method also copies memory from the
appropriate *copyaside buffer* as necessary. Copyaside buffers are created by
the :cpp:func:`split_at` method and represent extensions to the current cache
segment.

.. todo::
   Expose the underlying memory segments directly to higher level processing,
   such as parsing, to eliminate the memory copy overhead that
   :cpp:func:`get_bytes` carries. Note that this comes at the cost of some
   horrid bookkeeping on the part of the higher level functions. The
   :cpp:func:`get_bytes` method exists to handle this bookkeeping.

The :cpp:func:`split_at` method copies up to ``pos`` bytes from the beginning
of the current cache segment into a copyaside buffer. The copyaside buffer will
then be available for the previous (in terms of lookup table index modulo the
number of threads) cache segment. This method helps with multi-threaded parsing
of files when parser offsets into a file do not correspond with record
boundaries. A parser can scan forward to the next record boundary and then set
the scanned over bytes aside to be appended to the cache segment which contains
the beginning of the partial record.

The initial implementation of the cache manager used *setaside buffers*, which
were just reserved portions of cache segments and no memory copies were
performed. However, the bookkeeping was quite complicated and after several
bugs slipped through the cracks, the setaside buffer logic was converted to
copyaside buffers. The cost of the memory copies is essentially nothing in the
typical use cases encountered by the software. Copyaside buffers are also much
more amenable to asychronous refilling of cache segments, should that be
supported at a later point.

.. todo::
   Implement asynchronous refills of cache segments.

Reads and Read Pairs
--------------------

Reads are simple data structures which contain genomic sequences, as well
identifiers and quality scores for those sequences. The class is declared in
:file:`lib/read_parsers.hh`.

.. cpp:class:: Read

The Python wrapper exposes an interface to reads.

.. py:class:: Read

The data members are accessed as properties. These mimick the access keys for
``screed`` records.

.. py:attribute:: Read.name

.. py:attribute:: Read.sequence

.. py:attribute:: Read.accuracy

.. py:attribute:: Read.annotations

No distinction is currently made between FASTA and FASTQ reads.

.. todo::
   Create an IRead abstract base class and subclass for FASTA and FASTQ record
   types. This would remove wasted fields for FASTA records and allow the type
   of records being used at any level of processing.

Read pairs are two reads bound together in a STL ``pair``. This is intended to
track sequences with paired ends.

Read Parsers
------------

C++ API
~~~~~~~
   
Read parsers create the aforementioned :cpp:class:`Read` objects. The
:file:`lib/read_parsers.hh` file declares an abstract base class as well as
FASTA and FASTQ parsers derived from that.

.. cpp:class:: IParser

.. cpp:class:: FastaParser

.. cpp:class:: FastqParser

An instance of the appropriate sublcass is created via a factory method
provided by the abstract class. This method infers the correct subclass
instance to create based on file name extension. The file name is required but
the other arguments are optional. If the other arguments are supplied, then
they override the defaults from the active :cpp:class:`Config` object.

.. cpp:function:: IParser * const IParser::get_parser( std::string const &ifile_name, uint32_t const number_of_threads, uint64_t const cache_size, uint8_t const trace_level )

.. todo::
   Sniff file type rather than rely on extension.

Just as the :cpp:class:`CacheManager` maintains per-thread state in
:cpp:class:`CacheSegment` objects, the parser classes maintain per-thread state
in special objects as well.

.. cpp:class:: ParserState

The parser state maintains a line buffer, among other things, and tracks how
much of it has been parsed by each call to the parser.

The :cpp:class:`IParser` interface provides some useful methods.

.. cpp:function:: bool IParser::is_complete( )

.. cpp:function:: void IParser::imprint_next_read( Read &the_read )

.. cpp:function:: void IParser::imprint_next_read_pair( ReadPair &the_read_pair, uint8_t mode = PAIR_MODE_ERROR_ON_UNPAIRED )

The :cpp:func:`is_complete` method checks if parsing of the current stream is
complete and blocks in a synchronization barrier if it is but some threads are
still working.

The :cpp:func:`imprint_next_read` method attempts to parse another read from
the file stream and create a :cpp:class:`Read` object from it. Note that a
legacy method ``get_next_read`` is still available but its use in new code is
discouraged.  The legacy method involves an additional memory copy.

The :cpp:func:`imprint_next_read_pair` method attempts to parse a pair of reads
from the file stream a create a `ReadPair` object from them. Currently, this
has two implemented modes of operation with a third one planned. The modes are
``PAIR_MODE_ALLOW_UNPAIRED``, ``PAIR_MODE_IGNORE_UNPAIRED``, and
``PAIR_MODE_ERROR_ON_UNPAIRED``. The first one is not yet implemented; it may
be useful for filtering or diverting paired or unpaired reads out of a stream.
The ``PAIR_MODE_IGNORE_UNPAIRED`` mode simply ignores unpaired reads and only
returns paired reads. The ``PAIR_MODE_ERROR_ON_UNPAIRED`` mode raises an
exception if an unpaired read is encountered. As a note, both the old-style
("/1" and "/2") and new-style ("1..." and "2:...") Illumina read pairs are
detected from sequence identifiers.

.. todo::
   Implement ``PAIR_MODE_ALLOW_UNPAIRED`` mode.

.. todo::
   Place burden of input parsing and output formatting on :cpp:class:`Read`
   obects rather than on parser methods. Demote parsers to role of facilitator.
   Maybe?

Python Wrapper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python wrapper exposes a read parser class.

.. py:class:: ReadParser

This class has no subclasses, but handles various formats appropriately. An
instance of the class is an iterator, which produces one read at a time. There
is also a method for iterating over read pairs and the class exposes the same
constants for controlling its behavior as the underlying C++ class does.

.. py:method:: ReadParser.iter_read_pairs( pair_mode )
