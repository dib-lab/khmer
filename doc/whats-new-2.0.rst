What's New In khmer 2.0?
########################

All binary khmer formats (presence tables, counting tables, tag sets, stop tags,
and partition subsets) have changed. Files are
now pre-pended with the string ``OXLI`` to indicate that they are from this
project.

Files of the above types made in previous versions of khmer are not compatible
with v2.0; the reverse is also true.
