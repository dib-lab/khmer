A Quick Guide to Testing (for khmer)
====================================

One of our most important "secret sauces" for khmer development is
that we do a fair bit of testing to make sure our code works and keeps
working!

* We maintain fairly complete test coverage of our code.  What this
  means is that we have automated tests that, when run, execute most
  of the lines of Python and C++ code in our lib/, khmer/ and scripts/
  directories.  This doesn't *guarantee* things are correct, but it
  does mean that at least most of the code works at some basic level.

* we have other tests that we run periodically (for example, before
  each release) -- see :doc:`../release` for details.  These tests
  check that our code works on multiple systems and with other
  people's software.

CTB and others have written a great deal about testing, and testing in
Python in particular.  Here's an `introductory guide
<http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/nose-intro.html>`__ CTB wrote a long
time ago.

But... how do you do testing??

----

First, let's talk about specific choices for testing.  What should you
be aiming for in your tests?  You can always add more testing code,
but that might not be useful.

We suggest the following approach to writing tests for **new code**:

#. Write a test that just *runs* the new code, generally by copying existing
   test code to a new test and changing it.  Don't do anything clever for the
   first test -- just run something straightforward, and try to use existing
   data.

#. Decide which use cases should be tested.  This is necessarily code
   specific but our main advice is "don't be clever" -- write some tests
   to make sure that the code basically works.

#. Add in tests for edge cases.  By this we mean look for special cases in
   your code -- if statements, fencepost bound errors, etc. -- and write
   tests that exercise those bits of code specifically.

For adding tests to **old code**, we recommend a mix of two approaches:

#. use `"stupidity driven testing"
   <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/stupidity-driven-testing.html>`__ and
   write tests that recapitulate bugs before we fix those bugs.

#. look at test coverage (see `khmer's cobertura test coverage, here
   <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/stupidity-driven-testing.html>`__) and
   identify lines of C++ or Python code that are not being executed by
   the current tests.  Then write new tests targeting the new code.

----

Next, to add a test, you have two options: either write a new one from 
scratch, or copy an existing one.  (We recommend the latter.)

To write a new one, you'll need to know how to write tests. For
getting an idea of the syntax, read this `introductory guide
<http://ivory.idyll.org/articles/nose-intro.html>`__ and the `official
documentation
<https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/writing_tests.html>`__.  Then
find the right file in ``tests/*.py`` and add your test!

A better approach is, frankly, to go into the existing test code, find
a test that does something similar to what you want to do, copy it,
rename it, and then modify it to do the new test.

----

Finally, *where* do you add new tests and how do you run just *your* test?

Put new tests somewhere in ``tests/*.py``.  If you have trouble
figuring out what file to add them to, just put them in *some* file
and we'll help you figure out where to move them when we do code
review.

To run one specific test rather than all of them, you can do::

  ./setup.py nosetests --tests tests/test_scripts.py:test_load_into_counting

Here, you're running just one test -- the test function named
``test_load_into_counting`` in the file ``test_scripts.py``.
