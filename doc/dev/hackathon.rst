Introducing...
--------------

khmer is a piece of scientific software that does cool stuff in biology.
(That's really all you need to know for the Hackathon, honestly; but you
can read more about khmer `here <http://figshare.com/articles/The_khmer_software_package_enabling_efficient_sequence_analysis/979190>`__ if you like.)

The important bit about khmer is that we develop it openly,
at https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer; we use reasonably OK software development
practices; and we're interested in spreading the gospel, so to speak.

So!  For this Hackathon, we're providing a "mentored software
development experience".  We'll walk you through the "GitHub Flow"
process `(link)
<http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__, which will
involve making your own copy of khmer, getting it compiled and running
the tests, claiming an issue, requesting a merge, watching our
continuous integration engine run your changes, and going through code
review. What fun!

To get started, go to :doc:`getting-started`!

You can contact us directly at khmer-project@idyll.org, but if you're
experience trouble of any kind, please feel to `create an issue
<https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open>`__
where we can help you out.  Also keep an eye on `issue #446
<https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/446>`__ where we're updating
Hackathon information more generally.

Problems, questions, and solutions
----------------------------------

#. I don't have access to a UNIX machine that can compile khmer.  What can
   I do?

   Contact us at khmer-project@idyll.org and we'll give you an account
   for the duration.  You'll need to have an SSH client, note.

#. There's a bug in this documentation! But I can fix it...

   Oh noes! Fixes are welcome -- these docs are in branch
   'docs/hackathon' on https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/, so please
   send PRs there.  Or if you haven't worked through the process yet,
   please `add an issue
   <https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open>`__ and we'll be on it.
