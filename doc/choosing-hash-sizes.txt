=============================
Choosing hash sizes for khmer
=============================

If you look at the documentation for the scripts (:doc:`scripts`) you'll
see two mysterious parameters -- ``-N`` and ``-x``, or, more verbosely,
``-n_hashes`` and ``--hashsize``.  What are these, and how do you
specify them?

The really short version
========================

There is no way (except for experience, rules of thumb, and intuition) to
know what these parameters should be up front.  So, make the product of
these two parameters be the size of your available memory::

  -N 4 -x 4e9

for a machine with 16 GB of free memory, for example.  Also see
the rules of thumb, below.

The short version
=================

These parameters specify the maximum memory usage of the primary data
structure in khmer, which is basically N big hash tables of size x.
The **product** of the number of hash tables and the size of the hash
tables specifies the total amount of memory used.

This hash table is used to track k-mers.  If it is too small, khmer
will fail in various ways (and should complain), but there is no harm
in making too large. So, **the absolute safest thing to do is to
specify as much memory as is available**.  Most scripts will inform
you of the total memory usage, and (at the end) will complain if it's
too small.

For normalize-by-median, khmer uses one byte per hash entry, so: if
you had 16 GB of available RAM, you should specify something like ``-N
4 -x 4e9``, which multiplies out to about 16 GB.

For the graph partitioning stuff, khmer uses only 1 bit per k-mer, so
you can multiple your available memory by 8: for 16 GB of RAM, you could
use ::

   -N 4 -x 32e9

which multiplies out to 128 Gbits of RAM, or 16 Gbytes.

Life is a bit more complicated than this, however, because some scripts --
load-into-counting and load-graph -- keep ancillary information that will
consume memory beyond this hash data structure.  So if you run out of
memory, decrease the hash table size.

Also see the rules of thumb, below.

The real full version
=====================

khmer's scripts, at their heart, represents k-mers in a very memory
efficient way by taking advantage of two data structures, `Bloom
filters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter>`__ and `CountMin
Sketches <https://sites.google.com/site/countminsketch/>`__, that are
both *probabilistic* and *constant memory*.  The "probabilistic" part
means that there are false positives: the less memory you use, the
more likely it is that khmer will think that k-mers are present when
they are not, in fact, present.

Digital normalization (normalize-by-median and filter-abund) uses
the CountMin Sketch data structure.

Graph partitioning (load-graph etc.) uses the Bloom filter data structure.

The practical ramifications of this are pretty cool.  For example,
your digital normalization is guaranteed not to increase in memory
utilization, and graph partitioning is estimated to be 10-20x more
memory efficient than any other de Bruijn graph representation.  And
hash tables (which is what Bloom filters and CountMin Sketches use)
are really fast and efficient.  Moreover, the optimal memory size for
these primary data structures is dependent on the number of k-mers,
but not explicitly on the size of k itself, which is very unusual.

In exchange for this memory efficiency, however, you gain a certain
type of parameter complexity.  Unlike your more typical k-mer package
(like the Velvet assembler, or Jellyfish or Meryl or Tallymer), you
are either guaranteed not to run out of memory (for digital
normalization) or much less likely to do so (for partitioning).

The biggest problem with khmer is that there is a minimum hash number
and size that you need to specify for a given number of k-mers, and
you cannot confidently predict what it is before actually loading in
the data.  This, by the way, is also true for de Bruijn graph
assemblers and all the other k-mer-based software -- the final memory
usage depends on the total number of k-mers, which in turn depends on
the true size of your underlying genomic variation (e.g. genome or
transcriptome size), the number of errors, and the k-mer size you
choose (the k parameter) `[ see Conway & Bromage, 2011 ]
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21245053>`__.  **The number
of reads or the size of your data set is only somewhat correlated with
the total number of k-mers.** Trimming protocols, sequencing depth,
and polymorphism rates are all important factors that affect k-mer
count.

The bad news is that we don't have good ways to estimate total k-mer
count a priori, although we can give you some rules of thumb, below.
In fact, counting the total number of distinct k-mers is a somewhat
annoying challenge.  Frankly, we recommend *just guessing* instead of
trying to be all scientific about it.

The good news is that you can never give khmer too much memory!  k-mer
counting and set membership simply gets more and more accurate as you
feed it more memory.  (Although there may be performance hits from
memory I/O, e.g.  `see the NUMA architecture
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Uniform_Memory_Access>`__.)  The
other good news is that khmer can measure the false positive rate and
detect dangerously low memory conditions.  For partitioning, we
actually *know* what a too-high false positive rate is -- our `k-mer
percolation paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4193>`__ lays out the
math.  For digital normalization, we assume that a false positive rate
of 10% is bad.  In both cases the data-loading scripts will exit with
an error-code.

Rules of thumb
--------------

Juse use -N 4, always, and vary the -x parameter.

For digital normalization, we recommend:

 - ``-x 2e9`` for any amount of sequencing for a single microbial genome,
   MDA-amplified or single colony.

 - ``-x 4e9`` for up to a billion mRNAseq reads from any organism.  Past that,
   increase it.

 - ``-x 8e9`` for most eukaryotic genome samples.

 - ``-x 8e9`` will also handle most "simple" metagenomic samples (HMP on down)

 - For metagenomic samples that are more complex, such as soil or marine,
   start as high as possible.  For example, we are using ``-x 64e9`` for
   ~300 Gbp of soil reads.

For partitioning of complex metagenome samples, we recommend starting
as high as you can -- something like half your system memory.  So if
you have 256 GB of RAM, use ``-N 4 -x 256e9`` which will use 4 x 256 /
8 = 128 GB of RAM for the basic graph storage, leaving other memory
for the ancillary data structures.
