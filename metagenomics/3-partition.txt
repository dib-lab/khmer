3. Partitioning
===============

.. note::

   Make sure you're running in screen!

Start with the QC'ed files from :doc:`2-diginorm` or copy them into a
working directory.

Simple partitioning
===================

Partitioning is a rather complex process -- nowhere near as nice and
simple as digital normalization.  However, we do have a simple script
to run the basic stuff; if this script is too slow, or doesn't work
well for big chunks of data, we might have remedies.  But for the
meantime, try the simple script::

   /usr/local/share/khmer/scripts/do-partition.py -k 32 -x 1e9 --threads 4 kak *.kak.qc.fq.gz
   
This should take about 15 minutes, and will produce '.part' files.  These
are now FASTA files that contain partition annotations.  For example, check
out::

   head SRR492065.pe.kak.qc.fq.gz.part

Extracting the partitions into groups
=====================================

Generally there are *lots* of partitions, and for convenience sake we
group them into group files that can be assembled in small chunks.
To do this, ::

   /usr/local/share/khmer/scripts/extract-partitions.py -X 100000 kak *.part

This will leave you with a bunch of 'kak.group*.fa', as well as a '.dist'
file containing the distribution of partition sizes (how many sequences are
in a given partition).

Here, the '-X' sets the number of sequences stuck into a group file.
By default the -X parameter is 1 million, which would put all of the
sequences into a single file for this data set.

Occasionally (OK, rather frequently) you'll find that almost all of
your sequences coalesce into one partition, which we unaffectionately
call the 'lump'.  There are many possible reasons for this, and we
have a series of increasingly large hammers that can be used on the
lump.

For now, simply observe that::

   tail kak.dist

reports that about 2/3 of the sequences are in a single partition::

   1674746 1 112164 2539252

Reinflating partitions (optional)
=================================

At this point it's worth noting that the partitions are *normalized*,
that is, diginormed.  That makes it hard to use them for abundance
calculations, and some assemblers prefer to have the original
abundances in there.

So, ran you recover the abundances?  Of course you can!  However, you
do have to combine all of the raw (unpartitioned) reads into a single
file, because the script to reinflate the partitions takes only single
file.  Sorry :(. ::

   gunzip -c /class/cbrown/data/SRR49206?.?e.qc.fq.gz > all.fq
   python /usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox/sweep-reads3.py -x 1e8 kak.group*.fa all.fq
