find-knot speedup:
   - too many redundant rounds of partitioning?

memory improvement for counting hash

sequence loading into both counting & hashbits

graphsize filtering with stop-big-traversal

why does stop-big-traversal still connect???

cython integrate!

----

counting hash generalization to n < 8 bits => memory efficiency

load-counting/bigcount loading is slooooow

----

screed bzip
screed slice
screed fasta/fastq output

screed streaming foo

---

fix tests cleanup
pyrex/cython stuff
script testing
docs!

---

the N dilemma

---


put in logging.

fix tests and test cases to properly isolate/remove temp files.

fix dir(ht)

rename new_hashtable to new_countinghash

###

Semi-obsolete comments, pre partitioning:

also, can probably arrange parallelization split & hash table size so
that modulus exactly fills split portion of table.

mismatch hashing - compute min num - each base?

copyright, C++ file comments at top; license; etc.

tests for readmask updating, etc. in various circumstances!

tests for khmer saturation vs valid reads
