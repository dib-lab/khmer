    abstract ={Deep sequencing has enabled the investigation of a wide range of
environmental microbial ecosystems, but the high memory requirements for de
novo assembly of short-read shotgun sequencing data from these complex
populations are an increasingly large practical barrier. Here we introduce a
memory-efficient graph representation with which we can analyze the k-mer
connectivity of metagenomic samples. The graph representation is based on a
probabilistic data structure, a Bloom filter, that allows us to efficiently
store assembly graphs in as little as 4 bits per k-mer, albeit inexactly. We
show that this data structure accurately represents DNA assembly graphs in low
memory. We apply this data structure to the problem of partitioning assembly
graphs into components as a prelude to assembly, and show that this reduces the
overall memory requirements for de novo assembly of metagenomes. On one soil
metagenome assembly, this approach achieves a nearly 40-fold decrease in the
maximum memory requirements for assembly. This probabilistic graph
representation is a significant theoretical advance in storing assembly graphs
and also yields immediate leverage on metagenomic assembly.},

    abstract = {<p>K-mer abundance analysis is widely used for many purposes in
nucleotide sequence analysis, including data preprocessing for de novo
assembly, repeat detection, and sequencing coverage estimation. We present the
khmer software package for fast and memory efficient <italic>online</italic>
counting of k-mers in sequencing data sets. Unlike previous methods based on
data structures such as hash tables, suffix arrays, and trie structures, khmer
relies entirely on a simple probabilistic data structure, a Count-Min Sketch.
The Count-Min Sketch permits online updating and retrieval of k-mer counts in
memory which is necessary to support online k-mer analysis algorithms. On
sparse data sets this data structure is considerably more memory efficient than
any exact data structure. In exchange, the use of a Count-Min Sketch introduces
a systematic overcount for k-mers; moreover, only the counts, and not the
k-mers, are stored. Here we analyze the speed, the memory usage, and the
miscount rate of khmer for generating k-mer frequency distributions and
retrieving k-mer counts for individual k-mers. We also compare the performance
of khmer to several other k-mer counting packages, including Tallymer,
Jellyfish, BFCounter, DSK, KMC, Turtle and KAnalyze. Finally, we examine the
effectiveness of profiling sequencing error, k-mer abundance trimming, and
digital normalization of reads in the context of high khmer false positive
rates. khmer is implemented in C++ wrapped in a Python interface, offers a
tested and robust API, and is freely available under the BSD license at
